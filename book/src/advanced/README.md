# Advanced Topics

This section covers advanced patterns for building complex Guido applications.

## In This Section

- [Creating Components](components.md) - Reusable widgets with the `#[component]` macro
- [Dynamic Children](dynamic-children.md) - Reactive lists and conditional rendering
- [Background Tasks](background-threads.md) - Integrating async operations
- [Widget Ref](widget-ref.md) - Querying widget bounds at runtime
- [Wayland Layer Shell](wayland.md) - Positioning and layer configuration
- [App Lifecycle](app-lifecycle.md) - Quit, restart, and exit handling
- [Context](context.md) - App-wide state without prop drilling

## When You Need These

These topics become relevant when building:

- **Reusable UI libraries** - Components with props and callbacks
- **Data-driven UIs** - Lists that update from external sources
- **Real-time applications** - System monitors, clocks, live data
- **Desktop widgets** - Status bars, panels, overlays
